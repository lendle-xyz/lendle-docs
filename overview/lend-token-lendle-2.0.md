# LEND Token - Lendle 2.0

We're excited to introduce **$LEND Tokenomics 2.0** at Lendle! After over two years of delivering real yields in DeFi on the Mantle Network, this upgrade focuses on sustainability, community power, and strong growth. It's designed to make $LEND a key tool for governance and rewards, putting real value back into your hands.

Our permissionless money market stays strong, sharing protocol revenue in top assets, building liquidity, and now enabling true community decisions.&#x20;

## Purpose and Key Features

$LEND is Lendle's core utility and governance token. It rewards active users and drives progress. With 2.0, it's even better:

* **Real Yields**: Suppliers earn from protocol fees like flash loans and borrowing—paid in stable assets for steady returns.
* **Governance Power**: Soon, holders can vote on important choices via our DAO, like markt settings and new features.
* **Targeted Rewards**: Earn $LEND through fun campaigns, quests, and liquidity boosts that focus on real impact.

This makes $LEND deflationary, useful, and aligned for long-term success.



## Main Changes

We've updated based on community feedback to reduce inflation and increase value:

* **No More Native Emissions**: Stopped ongoing $LEND rewards for lending/borrowing to reduce supply and focus on high-value activities.
* **Airdrop for Pending Rewards**: Unclaimed tokens from a snapshot will be distributed soon.
* **No Locking Needed**: Staking is now flexible without time locks.
* **Higher Base Yields**: Adjusted fees to boost APYs for all suppliers—better rates for your assets!

These changes make Lendle more stable and rewarding.

## Tokenomics Overview

Total supply is still 100,000,000 tokens. New mechanics reduce supply over time:

| Feature        | Old Model                 | New 2.0 Model                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Emissions      | Rewards for supply/borrow | Replaced by targeted campaigns  |
| Staking        | With locking and vesting  | Revenue shares, no locks        |
| Supply Control | Fixed schedule            | Buybacks, burns, liquidity adds |
| Governace      | None                      | Full DAO voting                 |

Fewer tokens mean more potential value as the protocol grows.

## Revenue Share for Stakers

We keep real yields but share smarter:

From borrow fees:

* 85% goes to suppliers (Supply APY).
* 15% goes as "protocol fees".

The protocol fees are then distributed as:

* 50% to suppliers: Raises APYs in all markets for better pools.
* 30% to $Lend: For buybacks, burns, or liquidity adds.
* 20% to Treasury: For building, safety, and partners.



## Governance

One of the most thrilling aspects of $LEND 2.0 is its evolution from a simple reward token to a powerful governance token. This unlocks true community-led decisions, where $LEND holders can propose and vote on key protocol updates.
