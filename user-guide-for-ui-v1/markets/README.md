On the Markets screen, you can:

* See the statistics of the Lendle protocol
* Vest any Lendle tokens that were rewarded
* Open each individual market by clicking on the asset logo for:
  * more granular statistics
  * to supply and/or borrow an asset
* See how much APY/APR a certain market yields
  * The APY/APR is split into 2 numbers
    * The first one being the APY that is either being paid (borrow) or given (supply) in lendle native assets [l-tokens.md](deposit/l-tokens.md "mention"). The amount depends on the market size and protocol fees generated. [#revenue-share](../../overview/lend-token-lendle-2.0.md#revenue-share "mention")
    * The second one being the APR, indicated by the Lendle token Icon. These rewards come from the Liquidity Incentives and are in our native token $LEND.\
      Unlike the first number, borrowers don't pay $LEND to borrow. So on both sides the APR indicated are rewards
