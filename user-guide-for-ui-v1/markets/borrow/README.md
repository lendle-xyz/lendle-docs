# Borrow

There are 2 ways to deposit and borrow assets through our UI

1\) Through the  [dashboard.md](../../dashboard.md "mention") page you can deposit and borrow with 1 click of a button.\
2\) Through the [..](../ "mention") you can borrow for each individual market and see the parameters that apply to the market, like liquidation threshold and loan-to-value %.\
\
The tutorial will follow the second method --> [how-to-borrow.md](how-to-borrow.md "mention")
