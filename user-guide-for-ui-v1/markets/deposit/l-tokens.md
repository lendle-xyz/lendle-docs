# L-Tokens

In AMMs, when a user provides liquidity, LP-tokens are minted and sent to the user. In Lendle, any asset deposited will give you 'L-tokens'. These interest-bearing tokens represent their underlying asset, for example:

* **Lusdt** for usdt that is deposited
* **Lwbtc** for wbtc that is deposited

The value of the L-token is pegged at a 1:1 ratio with the deposited asset and all accrued interest is distributed directly to the L-token holders.\
\
Converting L-tokens back to their underlying asset can be done on the [dashboard.md](../../dashboard.md "mention")\
\
Over at [mantle-contracts.md](../../../contracts-and-security/mantle-contracts.md "mention") you'll find the L-token contracts.
