* **Review Borrow Screen Details**:
  * Amount input: Enter the amount , with options for Half or Max.&#x20;
  * Transaction Overview: Health factor, Liquidation, Collateral usage, Gas fee. The overview updates live as you enter the amount. Ensure your post-borrow health factor stays well above 1.

* **Confirm the Borrow Transaction:** Click "Borrow" and confirm in your wallet.  If there's a "Continue" step first, review the summary before final confirmation.
* **Verify the Borrow:** After a few seconds, the popup closes, and the market page updates with your new borrowed balance.
