Repaying your loan can be done from the "Portfolio" tab. In this tutorial we will unwind the positions that we've created by following [How-To-Deposit](../../../user-guide-for-ui-v1/markets/deposit/how-to-deposit.md) & [How-To-Borrow](../../../user-guide-for-ui-v1/markets/borrow/how-to-borrow.md).​

​

**Enter the Repay Amount:** enter the amount to repay or click "MAX" to select the full owed amount.  If aiming to fully close the position, use "MAX." Click "Continue" to move forward.

* **Approve the Token Spend: a**pprove the transaction in your wallet to allow Lendle to access the exact repay amount from your wallet. Use default settings for security—confirm the popup. This is a one-time approval per asset if not done before.
* **Confirm the Repay Transaction:** verify the repay amount, new health factor, and any fees. Click "Repay" and confirm again in your wallet.



Once the borrow is 0 on the Dashboard, confirmation is complete. Check your updated positions, wallet balance.
