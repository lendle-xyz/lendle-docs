In this Tutorial we will be depositing MNT through the Markets

We've opened one of the markets from this screen, in this example it's MNT.

**Review  Information:**&#x20;

* **Reserve status & Configuration**: Check total supplied amount, supply APY and APR.
* **Collateral Usage**: Note the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Penalty.&#x20;
* **Borrow Info**: Total borrowed and borrow APY/APR.
* **Your Info**: Your wallet balance, available to supply/borrow, and buttons for actions. This info helps assess yields and risks before proceeding.

* **Approve the Token Spend:** Approve the transaction in your wallet to allow Lendle to access the exact amount. Confirm the popup.
* **Confirm the Deposit Transaction:** Click "Supply" and confirm again in your wallet. Pay the gas fee—this executes the deposit on the Mantle blockchain.
* **Verify the Deposit:** After a few seconds , the screen updates. Check your new supplied balance, updated wallet amount, and transaction links.

## Collateral

After you've deposited an asset, it will be enabled as collateral by default. A collateralised asset will activate your borrowing power and correlate with the number of loans you can make (depending on the Loan-To-Value \[LTV] settings of each market)

You can use the toggle on each asset in the Deposit screen to disable the asset from being used as Collateral. _Please note that this will influence your Health Factor and can lead to liquidation if this drops below 1_
