# Isolated markets

### Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

Lendle Isolated Markets allow users to lend and borrow assets in separate pools for specific pairs, such as sUSDe/USDE, cmETH/WETH and other pairs. These markets operate independently from pooled markets, where assets share collateral and liquidity. Each isolated market has its own collateral rules and insurance fund, reducing the risk of issues spreading across the protocol.​

### How Isolated Markets Function <a href="#how-isolated-markets-function" id="how-isolated-markets-function"></a>

In an isolated market:

* **Supply and Borrow**: Users supply an asset to a specific pair to earn interest, enabling borrowing of the paired asset.
* **Collateral Isolation**: Collateral is dedicated to one market, preventing volatility in one asset from affecting others.
* **Liquidation and Insurance**: Each market maintains its own fund to handle liquidation shortfalls, containing any losses within the pool.
* **Interest Rates**: Rates adjust based on supply and demand in that market alone.

### Benefits <a href="#benefits" id="benefits"></a>

Isolated Markets provide:

* **Improved Capital Use**: Collateral is allocated only where needed, avoiding excess requirements.
* **Better Risk Control**: Problems remain confined to individual markets, protecting the overall system.
* **Yield Flexibility**: Users can integrate with other strategies, such as liquidity provision or tools like Powder, Sats, and Sparks.
* **Protocol Growth**: New assets can be added with limited risk to the ecosystem.
