description: Managing your $LEND

# Manage

On the Manage page, you can:

* Stake your $LEND in our flexible staking contract;
* Lock your $LEND for 3 months;
* Manage your vested rewards;
* Claim fees accrued from Staked/Locked/Vested rewards
* Unlock vests early ( this incurs a 50% penalty )
* Claim any unlocked $LEND from vesting and/or locking

### Staking & Locking

Investors can share in the protocol's revenue by either staking $LEND in a flexible staking contract, or locking their $LEND, which gives them access to the income generated from early unlocks i.e., penalty fees collected from users who opt to unlock their tokens prematurely. Through this arrangement, we aim to reward those who stay committed to Lendle in the long term, rather than those who are merely flash farming.

Since Lendle generates fees on the tokens that are available in our lending market, users will receive their portion of the revenue in the form of these assets. For instance, when you claim your rewards, you will receive a mix of BTC, ETH, USDC, USDT & MNT.

### What is Staking?

\
$LEND stakers receive 50% of the protocol revenue. You can exit staking at any point without incurring a penalty during your staking period.&#x20;

### What is Locking?

Similar to staking, when you lock $LEND, you will earn a share of the protocol fees. Furthermore, because you are committed to the Lendle protocol for 3 months, you will also receive penalty fees from those who exit their reward vesting periods prematurely. **Early exit from a lock is not allowed.**&#x20;

### How does it work?

#### For suppliers and lenders:

* Once claimed, $LEND rewards are vested for three (3) months but can be withdrawn at any point with a 50% penalty.&#x20;
* Leaving the three (3) month vesting period prematurely always incurs a 50% penalty, regardless of the stage during these three (3) months at which you choose to exit.&#x20;
* The 50% penalty is constantly distributed to those who lock $LEND.&#x20;

#### For those who lock:&#x20;

* The locked $LEND must remain locked for a mandatory three (3) months and cannot be unlocked prematurely.
* The lock dates are organized by the week. Any lock between Thursday 00:00 UTC and Wednesday 23:59 UTC will be classified into the same weekly group and will be released at the same time, three (3) months later.
* $LEND rewards from locking $LEND can be claimed at any time without incurring a penalty. You will maintain the APR for locking $LEND after the three (3) months lock until you claim the newly unlocked $LEND.
