# How-To-Borrow

In this Tutorial we will be borrowing ETH against our DAI that we deposited in [how-to-deposit.md](../deposit/how-to-deposit.md "mention")

We've opened the ETH market from the [..](../ "mention")screen.

By clicking on the Borrow button we will be going to the Borrow screen for the ETH market.

At the top we can see the amount of ETH I borrowed, how much my collateral is worth and my current [health-factor.md](health-factor.md "mention")\
I already borrowed 1 ETH before and you can see at the top that I owe the protocol 0.0043 in ETH, this is the interest, or Variable borrow APY and increases the amount to repay with every epoch.\
\
At the moment, over 99% of the supplied ETH is being borrowed, which means that on the right, the interest we have to pay to borrow is very high. Why this is can be read in detail: [interest-rate-model.md](interest-rate-model.md "mention")\
\
There are 76 WETH available in the market to borrow and at the bottom you can see that, depending on what and how much collateral I deposited, I can borrow up to 5.3 WETH.&#x20;

For this example, let's go with 1 ETH and press Continue to go to the next screen:

Take note of the updated [health-factor.md](health-factor.md "mention"). Press Borrow to start, sign the transaction in your wallet and it should look something like this in the end:\
