# Withdrawing Assets

If you want to withdraw an asset, and thus swap your L-Token for the underlying asset, you should navigate to the **Dashboard** and click on 'Withdraw' for each market.

When withdrawing assets you are decreasing your collateral amount and thereby decreasing your health factor. Please take this into consideration before withdrawing any assets to prevent being liquidated.

{% hint style="info" %}
For a withdrawal to succeed, there must be enough liquidity available. This means that if the amount borrowed equals the amount deposited, you can't withdraw your liquidity. \
Try again at a later time when others have paid off their loans of that asset.
